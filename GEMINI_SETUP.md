## üîß Configuration

### Model Settings

The app uses `gemini-1.5-flash` by default, which offers:

- Good quality responses
- Cost-effective pricing

You can modify the model in `app/api/chat/route.ts`:

```typescript
const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ 
  model: "gemini-1.5-flash" // or "gemini-1.5-pro" for higher quality
});
```

### Available Models

- **gemini-1.5-flash**: Fast and efficient (default)
- **gemini-1.5-pro**: Higher quality, slower responses
- **gemini-1.0-pro**: Stable version

## üí∞ Pricing

Gemini API offers generous free tier limits:
- **Free tier**: 15 requests per minute, 1 million tokens per day
- **Paid tier**: Higher limits with pay-per-use pricing

Check [Google AI Studio pricing](https://ai.google.dev/pricing) for current rates.
